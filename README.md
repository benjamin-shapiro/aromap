# Project Title

aroMap

## Description

Our web application lets you track and report smells around your area! Smell something stinky? Report it! Smell something heavenly and want others to experience it? Enlighten your friends! In a world where smells are our most dear sense, aroMap is your guiding light.

## Using the Application

1. Log in to your Google Account
2. Enable location services on the web application
3. Click in the area where you wish to report a smell
4. Fill out the information about the smell you wish to report
5. Submit!
6. Click a smell on the map that other users reported to see its info

Stale smells should be cleared after a predefined period (via deletion) but this functionality is still WIP
